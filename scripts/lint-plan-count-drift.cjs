/**
 * Anti-divergence drift guard for the live-plan-counting seam
 * (epic #3180, issue #3183, ADR-3180 "Planning Semantic Model Single Owner").
 *
 * `src/plan-scan.cts`'s `scanPhasePlans` is the SINGLE canonical owner of
 * live-plan/summary counting: which files on disk are a "plan", which are a
 * "summary", and how the two pair up. Every other module that reads a phase
 * directory and re-derives that filename grammar itself — `readdirSync(...)`
 * filtered by an inline `-PLAN.md` / `PLAN.md` / `-SUMMARY.md` / `SUMMARY.md`
 * pattern — is a re-derivation that can silently drift from the owner (the
 * exact failure class this epic removes; see #2349, #1988).
 *
 * Per ADR-3180 Decision 4(a) this guard discovers call sites by SCANNING THE
 * WHOLE `src/` TREE, not by consulting an allowlist of known files — an
 * allowlist only measures re-derivations in files someone remembered to
 * list, and a new call site added anywhere else would sail through silently.
 *
 * Detection is intentionally NARROW and mirrors the existing
 * `lint-phase-id-drift.cjs` precedent: a small, readable per-line regex pair
 * over authored TypeScript source, with a short, explicitly-named exemption
 * list — not a general-purpose AST/control-flow analysis. A line counts as a
 * re-derivation when it contains BOTH:
 *   (a) a filename-TEST operation — `.filter(`, `.test(`, `.match(`,
 *       `.exec(`, `.endsWith(`, `.startsWith(`, `.includes(`, `.some(`,
 *       `.every(`, or `===` — and
 *   (b) a plan/summary filename-suffix pattern, either a quoted literal
 *       ('-PLAN.md', 'PLAN.md', '-SUMMARY.md', 'SUMMARY.md') OR an unquoted
 *       regex literal that mentions PLAN or SUMMARY and `\.md` together
 *       (`/-PLAN\.md$/`, `/^PLAN-\d+.*\.md$/i`)
 * on the same source line. #3183 originally required (a) to be specifically
 * `.filter(` on the SAME line as the literal — that missed a regex-literal
 * predicate (`files.filter(f => /-PLAN\.md$/.test(f))`, no quotes) and a
 * predicate defined on one line and consumed by `.filter(` on another
 * (`const isPlan = f => f.endsWith('-PLAN.md'); … files.filter(isPlan)`).
 * Widening (a) to any filename-test operator — not just `.filter(` itself —
 * catches both: the predicate's OWN line already carries a qualifying test
 * operation (`.test(`/`.endsWith(`) alongside the literal, independent of
 * where `.filter(` ends up.
 *
 * KNOWN, ACCEPTED limits of a per-line textual scan (same tradeoff the
 * phase-id-drift guard documents): a re-derivation that filters via a
 * hand-rolled loop with none of the listed test operators (e.g. a manual
 * character-index scan), or one whose literal and test operator are split
 * across two DIFFERENT lines with no single line carrying both, is not
 * caught by this narrow shape. That is left to code review, not this regex.
 *
 * The tree-walk / root-confinement / regex-literal-tokenizer / sanitizer
 * machinery below is SHARED with `scripts/lint-milestone-window-drift.cjs`
 * (#3184) via `scripts/lib/drift-scan.cjs` — see that module for the
 * `isInsideRoot` case-sensitivity note, the `walk` symlink-confinement
 * rationale, and the `readRegexLiteralAt` tokenizer's ReDoS-avoidance
 * rationale. It is deliberately NOT duplicated here a second time (ADR-3180
 * Decision 4's own "Rejected" list: "let the new drift guard copy Phase 1's
 * tree-walk / root-confinement / sanitizer").
 *
 * A regex literal longer than MAX_REGEX_LITERAL_LEN (400) characters is not
 * read, and is therefore not caught. That bound is what keeps the scan
 * linear; no real plan/summary filename filter approaches it. The scan is
 * scoped to SCAN_DIRS (`src`) with SCAN_EXT (.cts/.ts/.mts) — 186 files and
 * 4,299 lines matching FILENAME_TEST_RE within SCAN_DIRS/SCAN_EXT as of this
 * commit, 43 of them holding 7 or more backslashes and one (`src/milestone.cts`)
 * holding 16. (Definition used, so this is reproducible: walk SCAN_DIRS
 * filtering by SCAN_EXT exactly as `walk` does, split each file on `\n`, and
 * count every line for which the exported `FILENAME_TEST_RE.test(line)` is
 * true — independent of whether a PLAN/SUMMARY literal is also present on
 * that line.) Those are the lines the old backtracking detector had to
 * survive, and the reason the detector is now a tokenizer.

//   - audit.cts resolveQuickTaskSummaryFile: scans a quick task's OWN

//     record — not a phase directory's live-plan/summary counting question.
//     #3458 follow-up extracted this out of `scanQuickTasks` (the prior
//     exemption target) into its own function so `scanQuickTasks` (read) and
//     `cmdAuditAcknowledge`'s quick_tasks writer share the ONE discovery
//     rule instead of each re-deriving it independently.
//   - gsd2-import.cts readTasksDir: reads a FOREIGN GSD-2 legacy project's
//     `tasks/` dir convention during a one-time import, not this project's
//     `.planning/phases/` layout at all.
//   - estimate-cli.cts collectCalibrationSamples: pairs a PLAN.md and a
//     SUMMARY.md by their identical `<stem>` to build an estimation
//     CALIBRATION sample (projected vs. actual token counts) — a stem-keyed
//     join for a statistics question, not a live-plan/completion count.
//     It intentionally does NOT use the canonical three-candidate pairing
//     rule (marker-swap / `-SUMMARY.md` / extended) or exclude superseded
//     plans — an unmatched or superseded plan simply yields no sample,
//     which is correct for calibration, not a live-completion determination.
//   - roadmap.cts cmdRoadmapAnnotateDependencies: matches a plan-ID token
//     out of an ALREADY-RENDERED ROADMAP.md checklist LINE OF TEXT
//     (`- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — …`), not a filesystem directory listing — it
//     can never diverge from scanPhasePlans's file-existence rule because it
//     never tests file existence at all.
//   - worktree-safety.cts defaultFindSummaryFiles: a recursive walk of the
//     ENTIRE `.planning/` tree (not a single phase directory) for a
//     pre-merge rescue of any `*SUMMARY.md` artifact, deliberately mirroring
//     the shell fallback's own `find … -name "*SUMMARY.md"` glob (quick.md,
//     #2296/#2070/#2838) byte-for-behaviour rather than the phase-scoped
//     plan-scan owner's root+nested rule — "rescue every summary before a
//     merge blows it away" is not a live-plan/completion count.
//   - planning-snapshot.cts buildPerPhasePlanScanFields (Phase 12, #3310,
//     ADR-3180 §8.4): a strict `-(\d{2})-PLAN\.md$` match extracts a
//     zero-padded SEQUENCE NUMBER from filenames the owner (`allPlanFiles`)
//     already classified as plans, into the `perPhasePlanNumbering`
//     `PlanningSnapshot` field so `validate.consistency`'s C002 rule can read
//     it via the shared snapshot instead of re-scanning disk. It does not
//     re-derive "is this a plan" — it answers a different, narrower question
//     (does the canonical 2-digit numbering sequence have a gap) that the
//     owner's boolean plan/summary classification cannot answer.
