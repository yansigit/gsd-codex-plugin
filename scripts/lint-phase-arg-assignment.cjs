/**
 * lint-phase-arg-assignment.cjs — a workflow that READS `${PHASE_ARG}` must
 * also SAY where it comes from (#4777).
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * Seven workflows shipped an `init.phase-op "${PHASE_ARG}"` call with no
 * assignment anywhere in the file and no instruction to derive one. The
 * variable expanded to the empty string on every run, `init.phase-op ""`
 * resolved `phase_found: false` unconditionally, and each workflow fell
 * through to its own "phase not executed" exit with a blank phase number —
 * so `/gsd:secure-phase 4` reported that phase *nothing* was not executed.
 * Two of them had carried the defect since the files were created in March.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because the working pattern lived in a *different* file:
 * `verify-work.md` derives the value correctly, and a copy of an init block
 * that leaves the derivation line behind is indistinguishable, on review,
 * from one that never needed it.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A workflow whose bash blocks read `$PHASE_ARG` must carry one of:
 *
 *   1. a **shell assignment** matching one of the frozen `CANONICAL_FORMS`
 *      below, textually before the first read; or
 *   2. a **prose derivation step** — a line outside the bash blocks that
 *      tells the model to parse `$ARGUMENTS` into `$PHASE_ARG`
 *      (`execute-phase.md`: "First positional token → `PHASE_ARG`"); or
 *   3. an entry in `EXEMPT`, with a reason.
 *
 * ## Why the forms are frozen
 *
 * Requiring *an* assignment would be satisfied by a seventh hand-rolled sed
 * pipeline, which is how the two grammars in this tree already drifted apart.
 * The rule therefore pins the exact text. There are three legitimate ways a
 * workflow learns its phase — `$ARGUMENTS` positional, `--phase N`, and a
 * positional `$1` passed by a skill dispatch — and each has exactly one
 * spelling. A new grammar is a deliberate one-line addition here, reviewed
 * once, rather than a copy that diverges silently.
 *
 * Detection only: this lint never edits a workflow.
