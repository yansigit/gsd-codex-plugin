/**
 * `check verify-command-paths` as a gate module (#5139, epic #5056, ADR-5057 §4 first bullet,
 * #2401): it returns a `GateResult`; the command router formats it. Imports no io module and
 * performs no direct console/stdout/stderr write (ESLint-enforced).
 *
 * Probes every `<automated>` verify command declared in a phase's `-PLAN.md` files against the
 * filesystem WITHOUT executing anything — see `verify-command-grounding.cts` for the recognizer
 * contract.
 *
 * Argv after the verb: `<phase>` | `--dir <plan-dir>`.
 *
 * `--dir` (#4767) names a directory holding `-PLAN.md` files directly, for plans that live outside
 * `.planning/phases/` (quick mode's `.planning/quick/<id>/`). It is resolved against the project
 * root AND CONTAINED WITHIN IT — an absolute or climbing `--dir` that lands outside the root is
 * `unresolvable`, never read — then probed exactly as a phase directory is; `projectRoot` stays the
 * project root in both forms. `--dir <value>` is the only accepted spelling: `--dir=<value>`
 * yields no `dir` flag and falls through to the no-argument arm, as does an empty value (both are
 * `partitionPredicateArgs` behaviour, inherited and unchanged).
 *
 * When the phase cannot be resolved (or `--dir` escapes the root, or neither is given) the gate
 * returns a non-throwing degraded payload (status/commands/counts zeroed, `readError` populated)
 * rather than a usage failure — the plan-checker parses this result and must be able to tell
 * "nothing to report" from "could not look", which a thrown error would collapse.
 *
 * Containment is decided on the resolved target (ADR-4650: the probe's reads follow symlinks).
 * RESIDUAL, stated rather than left to be rediscovered: this is check-then-use, so a symlink
 * planted at the resolved path BETWEEN the containment check and the reads inside the probe would
 * be followed. A link already in place when the command runs IS refused. Closing the window needs
 * O_NOFOLLOW/dirfd semantics inside the ADR-4650 predicate — a wider change than this gate.
