/**
 * GateVerdict — the value a gate module returns instead of printing (#5139, epic #5056,
 * ADR-5057 §4 first bullet, design D1).
 *
 * A gate module decides; the command router formats. A gate imports no io module and performs no
 * direct console/stdout/stderr write (ESLint-enforced) — it returns one of two shapes:
 *
 *   - `GateVerdict`      the gate reached an answer. `outcome` names it, `block` is the gate's
 *                        own blocking decision (set explicitly by each arm, never derived from
 *                        `outcome`), and `payload` is the exact ordered object the router
 *                        serializes (insertion order is the wire order).
 *   - `GateUsageFailure` the caller invoked the gate wrongly (missing argument, escaping path).
 *                        The router turns it into `error(message, code)`.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no imports.
