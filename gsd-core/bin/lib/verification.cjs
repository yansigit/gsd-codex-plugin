/**
 * Verification Status — single queryable home for verification-status routing.
 *
 * Issue #651: consolidate the pass/gaps_found/human_needed routing that was
 * previously scattered across ship.md and execute-phase.md into a single
 * tested module. Both workflow files will later consume this module's routing
 * table as the single source of truth.
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: source in src/verification.cts, compiled to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/verification.cjs (gitignored).
 *
 * DEFECT.FRONTMATTER-SCALAR-BROAD-GREP fix: status extraction is scoped to
 * the leading YAML frontmatter block only. A `status:` line in the body (e.g.
 * inside a fenced code block) is ignored — this is the exact failure mode that
 * issue #586 / PR #650 identified. The shared extractFrontmatter parser anchors
 * its regex at byte 0 of the document, which provides this guarantee.
 *
 * #2348 staleness signal: whether a *-VERIFICATION.md is stale (a summary newer
 * than it) is decided from git commit time when a file is committed AND clean,
 * and from filesystem mtime otherwise. mtimes are assigned at checkout time and
 * are not preserved by `git clone` / `cp -R`, and any unrelated `touch` /
 * reformat / editor-save re-stales a valid report — so a committed phase could
 * read `passed` on one machine and `stale` on a fresh clone purely from checkout
 * order. Git commit time is content-tied and clone-stable; mtime is retained
 * only for uncommitted or working-tree-dirty files, where it is the true
 * last-changed signal. Both are real wall-clock change times, so the comparison
 * is sound even when one file uses each.

// ─── The closed VerificationStatus enum (#5118, ADR-5057 §1 / Phase 4) ────────
/**
 * The closed verification-status vocabulary. This module is its ONE owner:
 * every other `src/` site imports `VERIFICATION_STATUS` / `VerificationStatus`
 * (the ESLint rule `local/no-verification-status-literal` keeps a spelled
 * literal out of `src/`), every workflow reads the owner's query fields, and
 * the prose writer contract (`agents/gsd-verifier.md`,
 * `templates/verification-report.md`) is parity-locked to `VERIFIER_STATUSES`.
 *
 * `unknown` is not a member (#5118): it existed only to pass an out-of-set
 * report value along (#4817's `status: verified` → `/gsd-execute-phase`). An
 * out-of-set report value is now a `VerificationStatusError`, thrown where it
 * is read.
 *
 * Reader-only members — never valid in a report's frontmatter:
 *   - `stale`               the covered inputs moved after the verifier ran
 *   - `missing`             the phase directory exists and holds no report, or
 *                           the report has no `status` (the verify step never ran)
 *   - `unparseable`         the report exists but its frontmatter is not YAML
 *                           (#4806) — this one meaning only
 *   - `phase_dir_not_found` there was no phase directory to look in (ADR-5057
 *                           amendment 2, #4987) — a usage error, never
 *                           `execute-phase`
 *
 * An out-of-set report status is NOT a member either: the reader throws, and
 * `isPhaseComplete`'s no-throw projection of it is `status: null` with scope
 * UNREADABLE and `statusError` set (never `unparseable`).

/**
 * Bump on any change to the digest's input shape (path list, hashing order,
 * per-file hash algorithm) so an old stored digest can never collide with a
 * differently-computed new one — a version mismatch is just a mismatch.
 *
 * Version history:
 *   v1 (#4155) — every covered path's whole bytes, uniformly.
 *   v2 (#4623) — repo-wide planning documents (`isSharedPlanningDoc`) are
 *                excluded from the hash by construction.
 *   v3 (#5095, ADR-5057 Phase 2) — v2 PLUS: (a) report-shaped declared paths
 *                (`isVerificationReportPath`) are filtered before hashing — a
 *                report is never an input to its own digest (#4857); (b) the
 *                hashed set is the declared list UNIONED with the phase's own
 *                live `*-PLAN.md`/`*-SUMMARY.md` artifacts
 *                (`phaseArtifactPaths`), computed identically on both the
 *                emit (`cmdVerificationFingerprint`) and check
 *                (`readVerificationStatus`) sides — a plan/summary added
 *                after fingerprinting moves the digest itself, with no
 *                separate live-directory rescan needed (#4817); (c)
 *                containment additionally admits a `.planning`-spelled path
 *                whose realpath sits in one of the anchored planning scopes
 *                `resolveContainmentRoots` enumerates (`.planning`,
 *                `.planning/<project>`, `.planning/workstreams/<ws>`,
 *                `.planning/<project>/workstreams/<ws>`), covering a
 *                per-project/per-workstream store symlink (amendment 1,
 *                revised R7).
 *
 * A stored digest names its own version (`v<N>:sha256:…`), and
 * `readVerificationStatus` recomputes under the STORED version rather than
 * this constant — so bumping it does not flip every already-verified phase
 * to `stale` on upgrade. A legacy v1/v2 report keeps its own semantics
 * (shared documents included for v1; no report filter or artifact union for
 * either) until it is re-fingerprinted; only a version outside

 * `resolveUatFile` for `*-UAT.md`) delegate to — one rule, not two grammars
 * that agree today and drift tomorrow (epic #3473 F2's defect class).
 *
 * `bareName` is the artifact filename WITHOUT the leading dash (`'UAT.md'`);
 * a "dashed" candidate is any entry ending `-${bareName}`.
 *
 * Selection order:
 *   1. `options.phaseToken` given and `<phaseToken>-${bareName}` is among
 *      the candidates — that exact file always wins: it is THIS phase's own
 *      artifact, and no other candidate (whichever phase's token it carries)
 *      can outrank it (#3492 / #3518).
 *   2. Fallback — no exact phase-token match (or no token given): alphabetically
 *      first of the dashed candidates that are THIS phase's own, per
 *      `scopeToPhase(candidates, options.phaseDirName)` (#3511 reconciliation,
 *      below). Load-bearing: a phase whose only artifact is non-canonically
 *      named must keep resolving to it, not to null — this fix must not turn
 *      "found an artifact" into "found nothing" for anyone. A
 *      non-canonically-named artifact of THIS phase (e.g.
 *      `03-CORRECTION-VERIFICATION.md` in `03-foo`) still passes
 *      `isPhaseArtifact` (it names phase 03, same as the directory), so it
 *      is still returned here.
 *   3. `options.allowBare` only — a bare `${bareName}`, ranked BELOW both
 *      of the above. Rationale: a dashed file names its phase, a bare one
 *      does not, so a dashed file (canonical or not) is always the better
 *      answer when both exist. Reached when neither (1) nor (2) found any
 *      candidate — including when (2)'s scoping filtered every dashed
 *      candidate out as belonging to some OTHER phase.
 *
 * #3511 RECONCILIATION with `isPhaseArtifact` (`src/phase-id.cts`): that
 * predicate's own docblock used to flag this fallback as an open gap — its
 * aggregate scans exclude a cross-phase stray, but this single-pick resolver
 * did not, so it could return a stray as THE artifact while the aggregate
 * scans correctly ignored it. Closed by scoping step (2) above through
 * `scopeToPhase` (`src/phase-id.cts`, itself built on `isPhaseArtifact`):
 * `options.phaseDirName` threads the phase directory's basename in, and the
 * fallback now filters candidates through `scopeToPhase(candidates,
 * phaseDirName)` before picking alphabetically-first. This does NOT reopen
 * the #3357 guarantee — that guarantee is "a phase whose only report is
 * non-canonically named must keep working", and a non-canonically-named
 * artifact of THIS phase still passes `isPhaseArtifact` (it is membership by
 * phase number, not by canonical shape), so it is still returned. Only a
 * file belonging to a DIFFERENT phase is now excluded — and excluding it is
 * correct: returning another phase's artifact as this phase's own is worse
 * than reporting none (confidently wrong beats honestly empty).
 * The fail-safe now lives entirely inside `isPhaseArtifact`, not in
 * `scopeToPhase` (which is a plain filter with no unfiltered fallback):
 * (a) when phase-number membership cannot be determined for `phaseDirName` at
 * all (no reliable token — the zero-token directory case), every candidate is
 * treated as belonging to the phase; (b) the `firstLetterPrefixed`
 * bracket-ambiguity case, where a letter-prefixed-decimal dir is
 * string-indistinguishable from a bracket-dir token, also includes
 * everything rather than guess; (c) a token-less filename (bare
 * `${bareName}`) is accepted by directory containment alone. Outside
 * those cases, when scoping DOES remove every dashed candidate — a real
 * cross-phase stray, or a phase whose own artifact is genuinely absent — the
 * fallback below correctly falls through to `allowBare`/`null`: reporting no
 * artifact, not another phase's. `options.phaseDirName` omitted entirely skips
 * the filter outright (the ternary below), which is unscoped, pre-#3511
 * behavior.
 *
 * Pure — takes an already-read directory listing and does no I/O of its own,
 * so every call site keeps its existing `fsImpl` seam and no-throw contract
 * untouched.

 *
 * DISK-STRICT (#2957, maintainer decision 2026-08-08; ADR-3180 §7.4 amended
 * af92fd4c9): readVerificationStatus is called UNCONDITIONALLY here — plan
 * count is NOT a precondition. A phase with zero plans and a passing
 * `*-VERIFICATION.md` is complete (#3168). A ROADMAP checkbox has no machine
 * authority and is never consulted — this function never reads ROADMAP.md.
 *
 * `complete` is exactly `verification.status === VERIFICATION_STATUS.PASSED`.
 * `verification` carries the FULL routing result
 * (status/next_action/next_command/route), so a caller can distinguish a
 * failing verdict (`gaps_found`/`human_needed`/`stale`) from an absent one
 * (`missing`) — both are "not complete", but they are not the same
 * non-answer.
 *
 * #5118: a report whose `status` is outside the closed set does NOT throw
 * out of here (ADR-5057 :223 — the no-throw contract Phases 2–4 preserve): it
 * degrades to scope UNREADABLE, `verification.status` is `null` (route `''`,
 * the error's message as `next_action`), `complete` is false, and
 * `value.statusError` holds the typed error for the caller to carry.
 *
 * `scope` is UNREADABLE when `phaseDir` itself could not be listed — this is
 * INDEPENDENT of readVerificationStatus's own no-throw fail-open contract for
 * a missing `*-VERIFICATION.md` file (a well-formed answer,
 * `verification.status === 'missing'`, scope COMPLETE): a caller must not
 * read `value.complete: false` here as a confident "not complete" the way it
 * can for a genuinely-checked missing file.
 *
 * Does NOT import scanPhasePlans / plan-scan.cjs — the owner consumes plan
 * counts from its caller when a caller needs them for a different question
 * (e.g. buildPhaseCompletionProjection's own `implementation_complete`); it
 * never re-derives or requires them itself.

 * Finds the LAST `## <heading> <date>` block in `content` — a level-2
 * heading whose text matches `^<heading> (\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\b` — via the
 * shared, fence-aware `tokenizeHeadings`/`collectSection` primitives (#5105
 * S6) instead of a hand-rolled `^## ` scan: a `## <heading> <date>`-looking
 * line inside a fenced code block is not a heading and cannot be selected,
 * and a heading whose trailing word ISN'T a date (e.g. the template's bare
 * `## Security Audit Trail`) is not matched either (#5105 S4 — the anchored
 * heading date shape, not `(\S+)`, is what excludes it).
 *
 * Comparison (#5105 S4) is over the block's PARSED table rows
 * (`parseAuditTableRows`/`auditRowsEqual`) — whitespace/separator-width
 * insensitive, order-insensitive, and tolerant of an optional blank line
 * after the heading — never a byte-for-byte body string compare. Identical
 * rows on the last block → `{ appended: false }`, no write. Different rows
 * (or no prior block) → appends the new block at the end and returns
 * `{ appended: true }`.
 *
 * Deliberately compares against the LAST block only, never any earlier one —
 * a re-audit that regresses back to an earlier count must still append.
 *
 * `date` defaults through the `clock` seam (default: the global `Date`
 * constructor) rather than a bare `new Date()` call, so a caller can pin the
 * date deterministically — directly (pass `clock`) or via `node:test`
 * `mock.timers` (which replaces global `Date`, picked up automatically since
