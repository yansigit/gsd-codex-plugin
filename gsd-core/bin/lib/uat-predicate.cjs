 * a nested sub-list item (e.g. a `  artifacts:` key followed by an indented

/**
 * #4983: true only when EVERY `## Gaps` entry recorded against `testNum` is a
 * verified resolution — never on the presence of just one resolved entry,
 * since a later regression re-opens the SAME test number with a fresh
 * `gap_id` (per verify-work.md's reconcile_gaps contract) while a prior entry
 * for it stays `resolved`; an unresolved regression must still block.
 *
 * A single entry only counts as a verified resolution when ALL of:
 *  - `status` is `resolved` (an entry with no gap recorded, or `status:
 *    failed`/blank, is not a resolution — fails closed);
 *  - `resolved_by` is non-empty (a partial resolution missing the writer's
 *    attribution fails closed, per #4983's acceptance criteria);
 *  - `resolved_by`, taken as a bare basename (rejecting any path separator —
 *    no directory traversal), names a `*-PLAN.md` file that actually exists
 *    in this phase directory;
 *  - that plan has a matching `*-SUMMARY.md` sibling in the same directory —
 *    the same "plan executed" evidence verify-work.md's own reconcile_gaps
 *    step requires (elaboration.md §1) before it ever writes `resolved_by`;
 *  - the entry's own `gap_id` is present, AND the named plan's frontmatter
 *    `gap_ids` array includes it — proof the plan resolved THIS gap, not
 *    some other one.
 *
 * The `gap_id` cross-check (#4983 review round 1, CRITICAL) closes a false-
 * green a plan-existence-only check leaves wide open: `resolved_by` naming a
 * real, executed plan is not proof that plan addressed THIS gap. Concretely,
 * a phase with a legitimately-resolved gap on test 3 (`resolved_by:
 * 05-02-PLAN.md`, `05-02-PLAN.md`'s own `gap_ids: [G-05-3]`) could otherwise
 * have an UNRELATED, still-broken test 7 marked `status: resolved,
 * resolved_by: 05-02-PLAN.md` (copy-pasted or mis-attributed) and the prior
 * checks alone would accept it — `05-02-PLAN.md` and its SUMMARY genuinely
 * exist, they just never touched gap 7. Reading the plan's own `gap_ids` and
 * requiring it to name this entry's `gap_id` closes that: a resolution claim
 * this gate cannot independently verify against the phase directory's own
 * files, cross-referenced back to the SPECIFIC gap, is not trusted. An entry
 * with no `gap_id` at all (an older, hand-written entry predating the
 * `gap_id` convention) fails closed — there is nothing to cross-reference,
 * so it cannot be verified.
 *
 * This is deliberately MORE than a text-only trust check (contrast the
 * `DEFERRED_REASON_RE` deferred-skip case above, an accepted authoring
 * contract, not a security boundary): #4983's acceptance criteria explicitly
 * requires that "a `resolved_by` that names no executed plan still blocks" —
 * reading this as "no plan that executed AND resolved THIS gap" is the
 * reading that actually closes the false-green risk, not merely "some plan
 * ran somewhere in this phase."
