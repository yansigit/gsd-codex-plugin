 * Frontmatter — YAML frontmatter parsing, serialization, and CRUD commands

 * from the prior hand-written .cjs; only strict types are added.
 *
 * ADR-3473 §8.1 (#3881): the read path is no longer a hand-rolled line
 * scanner. `parseGuardedYamlRegion` now parses through the vendored `js-yaml`
 * (`./vendor/js-yaml.cjs`, verbatim `node_modules/js-yaml/dist/js-yaml.js`)
 * under `FAILSAFE_SCHEMA` + `json: true` — every scalar comes back a string
 * (today's contract, no adapter needed) and duplicate keys overwrite
 * (last-wins, the documented invariant). What js-yaml does NOT do —
 * anchors/alias refusal, the #3257 comment channel, the #1882 truncation
 * probe, null-byte preservation and object-list flattening for the existing
 * string-shaped value contract — is layered on top, in one place, below.
 *
 * #5105: the WRITER — `spliceFrontmatter` and its layout, comment-classification, parse-budget
 * and read-back machinery — lives in `frontmatter-splice.cts`, split out by module ownership.

 * aliases) expands to tens of megabytes in a few milliseconds, and `.planning/` documents are
 * user-authored, untrusted input. Corpus occurrences of anchors/aliases/merge keys today: zero,
 * so refusing them costs nothing.
 *
 * This was originally a raw-text line regex, and it was bypassable: a quoted key (`"a": &x 1`),
 * a flow mapping (`{b: &x 1, c: *x}`) or a flow sequence (`[&x "q", *x]`) all define/use an
 * anchor while never matching the "bareword key, then `&`/`*`" line shape the regex checked —
 * so the exact expansion this guard exists to stop went straight through unrefused. Detecting a
 * YAML anchor with a regex is re-implementing a YAML parser in order to guard a YAML parser; the
 * fix is to let the real parser report it instead of re-deriving anchor syntax by hand. js-yaml's
 * `load` accepts a `listener` invoked once per parse event with the parser's internal `State`;
 * `state.anchor` is non-null on every event belonging to an anchored node, in every spelling
 * above (verified by execution against all four), so throwing the instant it is set aborts the
 * parse before any alias expansion happens — the 303-byte quoted-key bomb refuses in ~1ms rather
 * than expanding to ~35MB. A `<<: *base` merge key is refused too, because it can only ever
 * reference a previously anchored node — the alias itself trips `state.anchor`. A merge key with
 * NO alias (`<<: {b: 1}`) carries no anchor and is not separately refused: under
 * `FAILSAFE_SCHEMA` (no `!!merge` type resolution) it never actually merges — it parses as an
 * ordinary literal `"<<"` string key with a normal, non-expanding nested map — so it carries none

 * on anything js-yaml itself cannot parse or that this module refuses outright; callers decide
 * whether to surface that as `unparseableResult()` or use it as a truncation signal.
 *
 * Renamed from `parseYamlRegion` (post-#3881-review, finding 2): §8.1 says `parseYamlRegion` is
 * "deleted, not patched" — the hand-rolled line scanner that name identified IS gone, but the
 * name itself survived on a new function with two callers (`extractFrontmatter` and
 * `countKeysBeforeTruncation`) that could not be inlined without duplicating the
 * refusal/null-byte/comment-channel glue below. Renaming closes that gap literally: nothing in
 * this module still answers to the old hand-rolled scanner's name.
 *
 * RESTORED (fix #3881/#3881-followup-2, closes the #3705-shaped regression reported against
 * `tests/smart-entry.unit.test.cjs:867`/`tests/smart-entry.property.test.cjs`): a prior revision
 * of this function fell back, on a throw, to TWO hand-rolled re-implementations of YAML dialect —
 * `repairAmbiguousColonValues` (below) for `key: value: extra`-shaped ambiguous colons, and
 * `repairMalformedInlineArrays`/`splitLegacyInlineArrayItems` for a malformed/unclosed `[...]`.
 * Both were deleted in 810e5e508 after a sweep of every tracked `*.md` file in this repo (910
 * files) showed disabling each repair independently changed the parse result for zero documents.
 *
 * THAT SWEEP MEASURED THE WRONG POPULATION. `repairAmbiguousColonValues`'s one real dependent is
 * not a document committed anywhere in this repo — it is user hand-edited STATE.md content that
 * exists only on end users' machines and is pinned here by `tests/smart-entry.unit.test.cjs` (see
 * its own in-file comment: "silently re-opened #2571/#2570 for hand-edited STATE.md that omits
 * the template em dash"). The exact shape: `last_activity: 2026-06-08: reviewed the PR queue` — a
 * colon-separated date+description a user typed by hand instead of the template's ` — ` (em dash)
 * separator. js-yaml correctly refuses this as genuinely ambiguous YAML (a colon+space inside an
 * unquoted scalar opens a nested mapping key); the old hand-rolled scanner tolerated it by taking
 * everything after the first `key:` verbatim. A future sweep of tracked `.md` files will AGAIN
 * show zero dependents for this exact reason — the dependent never lives in this repo's tree, it
 * lives in a user's own `.planning/STATE.md`. Do not delete this again on that evidence alone;
 * `tests/smart-entry.unit.test.cjs` and the frontmatter-level row in
 * `tests/feat-3881-yaml-parser-consequences.test.cjs` are the actual proof the dependent exists.
 *
 * `repairMalformedInlineArrays`/`splitLegacyInlineArrayItems` stay deleted: their zero-dependents
 * finding was reverified directly (frontmatter/smart-entry/verify/roadmap suites all pass without
 * them) and, unlike the colon repair, nothing in the test suite or #2570/#2571 documents a
 * hand-edited-STATE.md shape that depends on inline-array leniency.

 * ADR-3473 §8.1 (consequence 4): the #1882 truncation probe used to run the SAME parser
 * (`parseGuardedYamlRegion`) over an unterminated region and count its keys — deliberately, so a second
 * "does this look like YAML?" matcher could never drift from the real parser. js-yaml is stricter
 * than the old scanner, though: the dominant real truncation shape (fence opened, well-formed
 * keys, then the document body follows with no closing fence) is *invalid* YAML — a plain-text
 * paragraph at column 0 right after a block mapping raises `bad indentation of a mapping entry`
 * — so a naive "parse the whole region, count keys on success" port yields 0 keys and goes
 * silent on exactly the case #1882 exists for.
 *
 * CORRECTED (post-#3881-review, finding 5): the original recovery — re-parse ONLY the exact
 * prefix named by `e.mark.line` — regressed on every realistic truncation shape actually
 * checked by execution: an unquoted-colon value (`title: a: b`) and a mis-indented sibling
 * key (`  plan: 2`) both raise "bad indentation of a mapping entry" ON the offending line
 * itself, so `mark.line` names that SAME line and slicing BEFORE it drops the offending
 * line's own key entirely — undercounting by exactly the key the probe most needs to see. An
 * open flow collection (`list: [a, b`) raises its error on the (nonexistent) line AFTER the
 * region's end, so the "marked prefix" still contains the same unterminated `[` and the retry
 * parse fails too, falling through to a hard `0`. And a refused anchor/alias/merge key throws
 * a mark-LESS `YAMLException` (`refuseAnchorsAndAliases`, thrown from inside the parse
 * `listener` before js-yaml attaches position info) — the `e.mark` guard was never entered at
 * all, hard `0` again, even though every other key in the region is perfectly valid.
 *
 * A first fix attempt tried shrinking the region line-by-line and re-parsing through the SAME
 * real parser only — still no second matcher. It did NOT recover any of the three shapes above:
 * the offending line in the first two IS the malformed token, at every possible prefix boundary
 * that includes it, so no amount of shrinking ever makes it parse; the only prefix that ever
 * succeeds is the one line BEFORE it, i.e. exactly the original bug's undercount. A parser-only
 * strategy cannot report a key whose own line is genuinely invalid YAML — the same limitation
 * that made the mark-based recovery fail in the first place. This means "the one real parser,
 * never a hand-rolled matcher" is unreachable for the truncation-probe's actual job (a lower-
 * bound COUNT of what looks like a key line, not a validity judgment) — this file already
 * accepts an independent raw-text matcher for the adjacent question of "is this shaped like
 * frontmatter" (`isFrontmatterShaped`, used by this probe's only caller), so `countKeysBeforeTruncation`
 * takes the MAX of two lower bounds: how many keys the real parser can recover from the longest
 * parseable line-prefix (still the primary signal — correct on the dominant fence-then-prose
 * shape, and on any prefix boundary that genuinely IS the truncation point), and how many
 * column-0 `key:`-shaped lines the raw text contains (recovers the three regressed shapes,

 * adds is that the second case is no longer *silent*.
 *
 * The discriminator is the reason this is not simply "opened but never closed". A Markdown

 * on the missing fence alone reports corruption on perfectly good Markdown. Instead the

 * yields **two or more** keys AND the region is uniformly frontmatter-shaped raw text
 * (`isFrontmatterShaped`).
 *
 * Two, not one, and the extra key is doing real work. A single `key: value` line is genuinely
 * ambiguous: `---` followed by `Note: this is a paragraph.` — or `Author:`, `TODO:`, `See:` —
 * is ordinary technical writing, a thematic break above a labelled line, and it parses as
 * exactly one key. There is no textual signal that separates it from a write interrupted
 * after its first key, so the threshold is set where the ambiguity ends. The cost is a false
 * negative on a file truncated after exactly one key; the benefit is silence on a very common
 * Markdown shape. That direction is deliberate and matches the choice already made at zero
 * keys: a false positive on valid Markdown is worse than a missed edge, because the
 * diagnostic is unconditional and cannot be turned off. Every GSD artefact this guards
 * (STATE.md, PLAN.md, ROADMAP.md, SUMMARY.md, agent/command docs) carries two or more
 * frontmatter keys, so the realistic interruption window stays covered.
 *
 * A closed region that js-yaml itself cannot parse (malformed YAML, or a refused
 * anchor/alias/merge key — ADR-3473 §8.1 consequence 6) returns `{}` carrying the

 * #3706 — Does this value need double-quoting when written as an AGENT
 * frontmatter scalar (`model:`, `variant:`)?
 *
 * Deliberately a superset of `scalarNeedsDoubleQuoting` rather than a second,
 * competing predicate: that one answers "can this open a plain scalar safely",
 * which is necessary but not sufficient for a value that must ROUND-TRIP as the
 * exact string it went in as. Keeping both here is the point — they are two
 * answers to one question and drift the moment they live apart.
 *
 * The extra clauses, each an observed mis-parse rather than a precaution:
 *
 *   - a non-alphanumeric first character. `scalarNeedsDoubleQuoting` rejects the
 *     indicators that cannot OPEN a scalar, but YAML still resolves plenty of
 *     values that open legally: `~` and `.inf`/`.nan` become null and floats,
 *     and a leading sign or dot (`+1`, `-0`, `.5`) becomes a number. Requiring
 *     alphanumeric-first covers that whole family at once, and costs nothing:
 *     every real model ID and effort level starts alphanumeric.
 *   - a trailing `:` — `model: foo:` is read as a nested mapping key and fails
 *     the whole frontmatter with "bad indentation of a mapping entry".
 *   - a boolean/null word — YAML 1.1 readers resolve `no`/`y`/`off`/`null` to
 *     non-strings, so a variant named `no` arrives as `false`.
 *   - a numeric-looking value, including the YAML 1.1 sexagesimal form: `12:30`
 *     resolves to the integer 750, and `:` is legal mid-identifier here.
 *   - a date. `2026-08-25` starts alphanumeric and survives every clause above,
 *     yet YAML resolves it to a Date object rather than a string.

 *
 * Pass `{ once: true }` to stop after the first block. Callers whose input is
 * an arbitrary user-authored document — rather than a GSD artefact with a
 * known doubling failure mode — need this: a body that opens with a
 * thematic-break-delimited section is lexically indistinguishable from a
 * second frontmatter block, and the greedy loop deletes it silently (#2703).
 *
 * Canonical home for this primitive (#2143 audit dedup): previously

 *
 * Each block is the one `locateFrontmatterFence` finds — the same block every reader and
 * writer sees — and the whitespace after its closing fence goes with it. Found while
 * implementing #5105: the previous regex needed a line ending before the closing `---` that
 * the opening fence's own line ending could not supply, so it could not see an adjacent empty
 * block (`---\n---\n`) and stripped through the first `---` in the BODY instead; it also
 * closed on any line merely starting with `---`, which no reader of the block agreed with.
 *
 * Whitespace BEFORE the opening fence is skipped here, and only here: readers see no block in
 * such a document, but this is the writer's strip step (`state update` strips the old block and
 * writes a new one), and not skipping it would stack a second block above the stale one. The
 * whitespace goes only when a closed block follows it; otherwise `content` is returned as is.
