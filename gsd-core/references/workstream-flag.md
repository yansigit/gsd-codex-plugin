# Workstream Flag (`--ws`)

## Overview

The `--ws <name>` flag scopes GSD operations to a specific workstream, enabling
parallel milestone work by multiple Claude Code instances on the same codebase.

## Resolution Priority

1. `--ws <name>` flag (explicit, highest priority)
2. `GSD_WORKSTREAM` environment variable (per-instance)
3. Session-scoped active workstream pointer in temp storage (per runtime session / terminal),
   when that pointer exists and is non-blank
4. `.planning/active-workstream` file — consulted whenever step 3 has nothing to say: either
   there is no session identity at all, or there is one but it has never pointed at a
   workstream. A session that already has its own pointer (step 3) is never overridden by
   this step, even if that pointer is stale.
5. `null` — flat mode (no workstreams)

## Why session-scoped pointers exist

The shared `.planning/active-workstream` file is fundamentally unsafe when multiple
Claude/Codex instances are active on the same repo at the same time. One session can
silently repoint another session's `STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and phase paths.

GSD now prefers a session-scoped pointer keyed by runtime/session identity
(`GSD_SESSION_KEY`, `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT`, terminal session IDs,
or the controlling TTY). This keeps concurrent sessions isolated while preserving
legacy compatibility for runtimes that do not expose a stable session key.

A session that has never set its own pointer inherits `.planning/active-workstream`
(step 4) rather than silently falling back to flat mode — this does not weaken the
isolation guarantee above: inheritance only fires when a session's own pointer is
absent, and a session that has ever set one is never repointed by the shared file.

## Session Identity Resolution

When GSD resolves the session-scoped pointer in step 3 above, it uses this order:

1. Explicit runtime/session env vars such as `GSD_SESSION_KEY`, `CODEX_THREAD_ID`,
   `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT`, `OPENCODE_SESSION_ID`,
   `GEMINI_SESSION_ID`, `CURSOR_SESSION_ID`, `WINDSURF_SESSION_ID`,
   `TERM_SESSION_ID`, `WT_SESSION`, `TMUX_PANE`, and `ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME`
2. `TTY` or `SSH_TTY` if the shell/runtime already exposes the terminal path
3. A single best-effort `tty` probe, but only when stdin is interactive

If none of those produce a stable identity, GSD does not keep probing. It falls
back directly to the legacy shared `.planning/active-workstream` file.

This matters in headless or stripped environments: when stdin is already
non-interactive, GSD intentionally skips shelling out to `tty` because that path
cannot discover a stable session identity and only adds avoidable failures on the
routing hot path.

## Pointer Lifecycle

Session-scoped pointers are intentionally lightweight and best-effort:

- Clearing a workstream for one session removes only that session's pointer file.
  This returns that session to step 4 of Resolution Priority above — it goes back
  to **inheriting** `.planning/active-workstream` (if a marker exists there), not
  to flat mode. A cleared session with no marker present resolves to `null`; a
  cleared session with a marker present resolves to whatever that marker names.
  To force flat mode for a cleared session, remove the shared marker file, or use
  an explicit override such as `--ws` / `GSD_WORKSTREAM` on the command in question.
- If that was the last pointer for the repo, GSD also removes the now-empty
  per-project temp directory
- If sibling session pointers still exist, the temp directory is left in place
- When a pointer refers to a workstream directory that no longer exists, GSD
  treats it as stale state: it removes that pointer file and resolves to `null`
  until the session explicitly sets a new active workstream again

GSD does not currently run a background garbage collector for historical temp
directories. Cleanup is opportunistic at the pointer being cleared or self-healed,
and broader temp hygiene is left to OS temp cleanup or future maintenance work.

## Routing Propagation

Every workstream-scoped workflow parses the `--ws <name>` it was started with out of
`$ARGUMENTS` in each shell fence that needs it (fences are separate shells, so nothing is
carried over between them) and sets `GSD_WS`:
- `GSD_WS` is `--ws <name>` when the command was started with `--ws`, and empty otherwise
  (flat mode, backward compatible). It is always re-assigned, so a stale value never leaks in.
- Every `gsd_run query agent-skills <agent>` and `gsd_run query init.*` call in those
  workflows forwards it as the single token `${GSD_WS:+--ws=${GSD_WS##* }}`. The explicit
  flag has the highest priority above, so the workstream a command was started for wins over
  the session pointer and the shared marker. The single-token form is required because zsh
  does not word-split an unquoted `$GSD_WS`.
- Workflows recognize the documented spelling `--ws <name>`; `--ws=<name>` is accepted by the
  CLI itself but is not parsed out of `$ARGUMENTS` by workflows.
- Routing suggestions (`/gsd:plan-phase {X} ${GSD_WS}`) carry the same value to the next command.
- Project and workspace lifecycle workflows (`new-project`, `new-workspace`,
  `list-workspaces`, `remove-workspace`, `update`) are root-scoped and do not forward it.

`tests/agent-skills.test.cjs` scans every fenced call in `gsd-core/workflows/` so a new call
that omits the flag fails CI.

This ensures workstream scope chains automatically through the workflow:
`new-milestone → discuss-phase → plan-phase → execute-phase → transition`

## Reserved names

`none` (case-insensitive) cannot name a workstream. `--ws none`, `--ws=none`, `GSD_WORKSTREAM=none`
and a pointer of `none` are all rejected with a "reserved" error, and `workstream create` and
`workstream set` refuse it unconditionally. The one exception on the read side is a
`.planning/workstreams/none/` directory that already exists: it stays addressable with `--ws none`
so projects that used the name before it was reserved keep working (the directory name must match
exactly; `NONE` is still rejected). Such a grandfathered directory is reachable through `--ws` and
`GSD_WORKSTREAM` only, because `workstream set none` refuses unconditionally. To force flat mode,
omit `--ws`, unset `GSD_WORKSTREAM`, or clear the pointer (`workstream set --clear`). The rejection
happens before any command runs, so a stale `GSD_WORKSTREAM=none` in the environment must be unset
first. The reserved list has a single owner
(`RESERVED_WORKSTREAM_NAMES` in `src/workstream-name-policy.cts`); near-misses such as `none1` or
`nonexistent` are ordinary names.
