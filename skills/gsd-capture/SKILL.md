<plugin_runtime>
- Resolve `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` from this skill's absolute `SKILL.md` path by ascending from `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` to `<plugin>`. Verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists there.
- Substitute that absolute path for every literal `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`; it is a skill placeholder, not an environment variable.
- Apply this recursively to loaded files: legacy `~/.claude/gsd-core` and `~/.codex/gsd-core` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core`, while legacy `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.codex/agents` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents`.
- Run GSD commands as `GSD_AGENTS_DIR="{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents" node "{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs"`. Prefix every direct or workflow-copied `gsd-tools` invocation with that same `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` value. Never use a project copy, PATH, or a global installation.
- Plugin-bundled `agents/*.md` files are the agent definitions for this runtime. Translate each `Agent(subagent_type="gsd-...", prompt=...)` call to the host's general delegation tool (for example `spawn_agent`), preserving the prompt. Track every returned agent id. Launch no more than the host's remaining child capacity at once (use three when unknown), wait for those ids with the host's agent wait primitive, and use each agent's returned final message as its result before starting the next batch. Never expect or read `async_launched.outputFile`.
- Map `AskUserQuestion` to the host's interactive questioning tool when available; otherwise show a numbered plain-text choice and wait for the user's reply. Map abstract tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`) to host equivalents.
- Generic delegated agents share the current working directory. Before such dispatches, record `none` with `gsd_run query dispatch-isolation --raw --force-isolation none` and omit all worktree/isolation arguments. Use an isolation argument only when the actual delegation API explicitly supports it. Never run parallel agents that may edit overlapping files in a shared directory.
- Plugin manifests do not activate the vendored GSD hooks. Enforce the workflow's protected-branch, write-boundary, base-check, and prompt-injection checks directly; never claim a hook ran.
- A matching plugin-bundled agent file makes that role available even if the global Codex agents directory is empty. Do not warn, run a global installer, skip the agent, or choose an inline/sequential fallback because global agents are absent. Fall back only when the host has no sub-agent delegation tool or the bundled agent file is absent. Include the resolved absolute plugin root and these adapter rules in the child prompt, and require the child to read `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents/<subagent_type>.md` before starting. The child must resolve that file's legacy paths through this plugin and translate abstract tool names to host equivalents.
- If the workflow's requested model is unavailable on the host, omit the model override and inherit the current model.
- These plugin adapter rules override contrary named-agent installation, output-file, isolation, hook, and fallback instructions in recursively loaded upstream workflow files.

<objective>
Capture ideas, tasks, notes, and seeds to their appropriate destination in the GSD system.

Mode routing:
- **default** (no flag): Capture as a structured todo for later work → add-todo workflow
- **--note**: Zero-friction idea capture (append/list/promote) → note workflow
- **--backlog**: Add an idea to the backlog parking lot (999.x numbering) → add-backlog workflow
- **--seed**: Capture a forward-looking idea with trigger conditions → plant-seed workflow
- **--list**: List pending todos and select one to work on → check-todos workflow
- **--list-seeds**: List/audit captured seeds (optional status filter) → list-seeds workflow
</objective>

<routing>

| Flag | Destination | Workflow |
|------|-------------|----------|
| (none) | Structured todo in .planning/todos/ | add-todo |
| --note | Timestamped note file, list, or promote | note |
| --backlog | ROADMAP.md backlog section (999.x) | add-backlog |
| --seed | .planning/seeds/SEED-NNN-slug.md | plant-seed |
| --list | Interactive todo browser + action router | check-todos |
| --list-seeds | Read-only seed list/audit (optional status filter) | list-seeds |

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--note`: strip the flag, pass remainder to note workflow
- If it is `--backlog`: strip the flag, pass remainder to add-backlog workflow
- If it is `--seed`: strip the flag, pass remainder to plant-seed workflow
- If it is `--list-seeds`: strip the flag, pass remainder (optional status filter) to list-seeds workflow
- If it is `--list`: pass remainder (optional area filter) to check-todos workflow
- Otherwise: pass all of $ARGUMENTS to add-todo workflow
</context>

<process>
1. Parse the leading flag (if any) from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Load and execute the appropriate workflow end-to-end based on the routing table above.
3. Preserve all workflow gates from the target workflow (directory structure, duplicate detection, commits, etc.).
</process>
