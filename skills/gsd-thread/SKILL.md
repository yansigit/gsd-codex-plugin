<plugin_runtime>
- Resolve `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` from this skill's absolute `SKILL.md` path by ascending from `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` to `<plugin>`. Verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists there.
- Substitute that absolute path for every literal `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`; it is a skill placeholder, not an environment variable.
- Apply this recursively to loaded files: legacy `~/.claude/gsd-core` and `~/.codex/gsd-core` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core`, while legacy `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.codex/agents` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents`.
- Run GSD commands as `node "{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs"`. Never use a project copy, PATH, or a global installation.

<objective>
Create, list, close, or resume persistent context threads. Threads are lightweight
cross-session knowledge stores for work that spans multiple sessions but
doesn't belong to any specific phase.
