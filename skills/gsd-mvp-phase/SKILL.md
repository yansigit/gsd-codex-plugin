<plugin_runtime>
- Resolve `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` from this skill's absolute `SKILL.md` path by ascending from `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` to `<plugin>`. Verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists there.
- Substitute that absolute path for every literal `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`; it is a skill placeholder, not an environment variable.
- Apply this recursively to loaded files: legacy `~/.claude/gsd-core` and `~/.codex/gsd-core` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core`, while legacy `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.codex/agents` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents`.
- Run GSD commands as `GSD_AGENTS_DIR="{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents" node "{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs"`. Prefix every direct or workflow-copied `gsd-tools` invocation with that same `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` value. Never use a project copy, PATH, or a global installation.
- Plugin-bundled `agents/*.md` files are the agent definitions for this runtime. Translate each `Agent(subagent_type="gsd-...", prompt=...)` call to the host's general delegation tool (for example `spawn_agent`), preserving the prompt. Track every returned agent id. Launch no more than the host's remaining child capacity at once (use three when unknown), wait for those ids with the host's agent wait primitive, and use each agent's returned final message as its result before starting the next batch. Never expect or read `async_launched.outputFile`.
- Map `AskUserQuestion` to the host's interactive questioning tool when available; otherwise show a numbered plain-text choice and wait for the user's reply. Map abstract tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`) to host equivalents.
- Generic delegated agents share the current working directory. Before such dispatches, record `none` with `gsd_run query dispatch-isolation --raw --force-isolation none` and omit all worktree/isolation arguments. Use an isolation argument only when the actual delegation API explicitly supports it. Never run parallel agents that may edit overlapping files in a shared directory.
- Plugin manifests do not activate the vendored GSD hooks. Enforce the workflow's protected-branch, write-boundary, base-check, and prompt-injection checks directly; never claim a hook ran.
- A matching plugin-bundled agent file makes that role available even if the global Codex agents directory is empty. Do not warn, run a global installer, skip the agent, or choose an inline/sequential fallback because global agents are absent. Fall back only when the host has no sub-agent delegation tool or the bundled agent file is absent. Include the resolved absolute plugin root and these adapter rules in the child prompt, and require the child to read `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents/<subagent_type>.md` before starting. The child must resolve that file's legacy paths through this plugin and translate abstract tool names to host equivalents.
- If the workflow's requested model is unavailable on the host, omit the model override and inherit the current model.
- These plugin adapter rules override contrary named-agent installation, output-file, isolation, hook, and fallback instructions in recursively loaded upstream workflow files.

<objective>
Guide the user through MVP-mode planning for a phase. The command:

1. Prompts for an "As a / I want to / So that" user story (three structured questions)
2. Runs SPIDR splitting check — if the story is too large, walks through Spike/Paths/Interfaces/Data/Rules and offers to split into multiple phases
3. Writes `**Mode:** mvp` and the reformatted `**Goal:**` to the phase's ROADMAP.md section
4. Delegates to `/gsd plan-phase <N>` which auto-detects MVP mode via the roadmap field

Phase 1 of the vertical-mvp-slice PRD shipped the planner-side machinery; this command is the user entry point for it.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. Equivalent API.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required — integer or decimal like `2.1`)

The phase must already exist in ROADMAP.md (created via `/gsd new-project`, `/gsd add-phase`, or `/gsd insert-phase`). This command does not create new phases — it converts an existing phase to MVP mode.
</context>

<process>
Execute the mvp-phase workflow from @{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/workflows/mvp-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all gates: phase existence, status guard (refuse in_progress/completed), user-story format validation, SPIDR splitting check, ROADMAP write confirmation, plan-phase delegation.
</process>
