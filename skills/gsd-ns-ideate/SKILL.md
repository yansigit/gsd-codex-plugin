<plugin_runtime>
- Resolve `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` from this skill's absolute `SKILL.md` path by ascending from `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` to `<plugin>`. Verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists there.
- Substitute that absolute path for every literal `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`; it is a skill placeholder, not an environment variable.
- Apply this recursively to loaded files: legacy `~/.claude/gsd-core` and `~/.codex/gsd-core` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core`, while legacy `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.codex/agents` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents`.
- Run GSD commands as `node "{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs"`. Never use a project copy, PATH, or a global installation.

Route to the appropriate exploration / capture skill based on the user's intent.
`gsd-note`, `gsd-add-todo`, `gsd-add-backlog`, and `gsd-plant-seed` were folded
into `gsd-capture` (with `--note`, default, `--backlog`, `--seed` modes) by
#2790. The capture target lists pending todos via `--list`.

| User wants | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Explore an idea or opportunity | gsd-explore |
| Sketch out a rough design or plan | gsd-sketch |
| Time-boxed technical spike | gsd-spike |
| Write a spec for a phase | gsd-spec-phase |
| Capture a thought (todo / note / backlog / seed) | gsd-capture |

Invoke the matched skill directly using the Skill tool.
