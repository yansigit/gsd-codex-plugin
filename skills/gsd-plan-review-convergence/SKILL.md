<plugin_runtime>
- Resolve `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` from this skill's absolute `SKILL.md` path by ascending from `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` to `<plugin>`. Verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists there.
- Substitute that absolute path for every literal `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`; it is a skill placeholder, not an environment variable.
- Apply this recursively to loaded files: legacy `~/.claude/gsd-core` and `~/.codex/gsd-core` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core`, while legacy `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.codex/agents` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents`.
- Run GSD commands as `GSD_AGENTS_DIR="{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents" node "{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs"`. Prefix every direct or workflow-copied `gsd-tools` invocation with that same `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` value. Never use a project copy, PATH, or a global installation.
- Plugin-bundled `agents/*.md` files are the agent definitions for this runtime. Translate each `Agent(subagent_type="gsd-...", prompt=...)` call to the host's general delegation tool (for example `spawn_agent`), preserving the prompt. Track every returned agent id. Launch no more than the host's remaining child capacity at once (use three when unknown), wait for those ids with the host's agent wait primitive, and use each agent's returned final message as its result before starting the next batch. Never expect or read `async_launched.outputFile`.
- Map `AskUserQuestion` to the host's interactive questioning tool when available; otherwise show a numbered plain-text choice and wait for the user's reply. Map abstract tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`) to host equivalents.
- Generic delegated agents share the current working directory. Before such dispatches, record `none` with `gsd_run query dispatch-isolation --raw --force-isolation none` and omit all worktree/isolation arguments. Use an isolation argument only when the actual delegation API explicitly supports it. Never run parallel agents that may edit overlapping files in a shared directory.
- Plugin manifests do not activate the vendored GSD hooks. Enforce the workflow's protected-branch, write-boundary, base-check, and prompt-injection checks directly; never claim a hook ran.
- A matching plugin-bundled agent file makes that role available even if the global Codex agents directory is empty. Do not warn, run a global installer, skip the agent, or choose an inline/sequential fallback because global agents are absent. Fall back only when the host has no sub-agent delegation tool or the bundled agent file is absent. Include the resolved absolute plugin root and these adapter rules in the child prompt, and require the child to read `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents/<subagent_type>.md` before starting. The child must resolve that file's legacy paths through this plugin and translate abstract tool names to host equivalents.
- If the workflow's requested model is unavailable on the host, omit the model override and inherit the current model.
- These plugin adapter rules override contrary named-agent installation, output-file, isolation, hook, and fallback instructions in recursively loaded upstream workflow files.

<objective>
Cross-AI plan convergence loop — an outer revision gate around gsd-review and gsd-planner.
Repeatedly: review plans with external AI CLIs → if HIGH or actionable non-HIGH concerns remain → replan with --reviews feedback → re-review. Stops when no unresolved HIGH concerns or actionable MEDIUM/LOW findings remain outside PLAN.md, or when max cycles is reached.

**Flow:** Skill("gsd-plan-phase") → Agent→Skill("gsd-review") → check unresolved HIGH + actionable non-HIGH → Skill("gsd-plan-phase --reviews") → Agent→Skill("gsd-review") → ... → Converge or escalate

Replaces gsd-plan-phase's internal gsd-plan-checker with external AI reviewers (codex, gemini, etc.). Plan-phase runs **inline** (bare Skill at depth 0) so it can spawn gsd-planner/gsd-plan-checker at depth 1. Review runs inside an isolated Agent (gsd-review is a Bash leaf — no sub-agents needed). Orchestrator only does loop control.

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate phase, run plan-phase inline (Skill at depth 0), spawn an Agent for gsd-review, check unresolved HIGH and actionable non-HIGH counts, stall detection, escalation gate.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API. Do not skip questioning steps because `AskUserQuestion` appears unavailable; use `vscode_askquestions` instead.

Phase number: extracted from $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Flags:**
- `--codex` — Use Codex CLI as reviewer (default if no reviewer flag given AND `review.default_reviewers` is unset; otherwise `review.default_reviewers` wins per ADR-0011 — #2315)
- `--gemini` — Use Gemini CLI as reviewer
- `--agy` / `--antigravity` — Use Antigravity CLI as reviewer (successor to the discontinued Gemini CLI)
- `--claude` — Use Claude CLI as reviewer (separate session)
- `--coderabbit` — Use CodeRabbit as reviewer (reviews the working-tree diff, not the source tree)
- `--opencode` — Use OpenCode as reviewer
- `--qwen` — Use Qwen Code CLI as reviewer (Alibaba Qwen models)
- `--cursor` — Use Cursor agent as reviewer
- `--ollama` — Use local Ollama server as reviewer (OpenAI-compatible, default host `http://localhost:11434`; configure model via `review.models.ollama`)
- `--lm-studio` — Use local LM Studio server as reviewer (OpenAI-compatible, default host `http://localhost:1234`; configure model via `review.models.lm_studio`)
- `--llama-cpp` — Use local llama.cpp server as reviewer (OpenAI-compatible, default host `http://localhost:8080`; configure model via `review.models.llama_cpp`)
- `--kimi-code` — Use Kimi Code CLI as reviewer (Moonshot AI)
- `--all` — Use all available CLIs and running local model servers
- `--max-cycles N` — Maximum replan→review cycles (default: 3)

**Feature gate:** This command requires `workflow.plan_review_convergence=true`. Enable with:
`gsd config-set workflow.plan_review_convergence true`
