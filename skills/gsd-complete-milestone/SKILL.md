<plugin_runtime>
- Resolve `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}` from this skill's absolute `SKILL.md` path by ascending from `<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` to `<plugin>`. Verify `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists there.
- Substitute that absolute path for every literal `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}`; it is a skill placeholder, not an environment variable.
- Apply this recursively to loaded files: legacy `~/.claude/gsd-core` and `~/.codex/gsd-core` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core`, while legacy `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.codex/agents` paths resolve to `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents`.
- Run GSD commands as `GSD_AGENTS_DIR="{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents" node "{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs"`. Prefix every direct or workflow-copied `gsd-tools` invocation with that same `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` value. Never use a project copy, PATH, or a global installation.
- Plugin-bundled `agents/*.md` files are the agent definitions for this runtime. Translate each `Agent(subagent_type="gsd-...", prompt=...)` call to the host's general delegation tool (for example `spawn_agent`), preserving the prompt. Track every returned agent id. Launch no more than the host's remaining child capacity at once (use three when unknown), wait for those ids with the host's agent wait primitive, and use each agent's returned final message as its result before starting the next batch. Never expect or read `async_launched.outputFile`.
- Map `AskUserQuestion` to the host's interactive questioning tool when available; otherwise show a numbered plain-text choice and wait for the user's reply. Map abstract tools (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`) to host equivalents.
- Generic delegated agents share the current working directory. Before such dispatches, record `none` with `gsd_run query dispatch-isolation --raw --force-isolation none` and omit all worktree/isolation arguments. Use an isolation argument only when the actual delegation API explicitly supports it. Never run parallel agents that may edit overlapping files in a shared directory.
- Plugin manifests do not activate the vendored GSD hooks. Enforce the workflow's protected-branch, write-boundary, base-check, and prompt-injection checks directly; never claim a hook ran.
- A matching plugin-bundled agent file makes that role available even if the global Codex agents directory is empty. Do not warn, run a global installer, skip the agent, or choose an inline/sequential fallback because global agents are absent. Fall back only when the host has no sub-agent delegation tool or the bundled agent file is absent. Include the resolved absolute plugin root and these adapter rules in the child prompt, and require the child to read `{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/agents/<subagent_type>.md` before starting. The child must resolve that file's legacy paths through this plugin and translate abstract tool names to host equivalents.
- If the workflow's requested model is unavailable on the host, omit the model override and inherit the current model.
- These plugin adapter rules override contrary named-agent installation, output-file, isolation, hook, and fallback instructions in recursively loaded upstream workflow files.

<objective>
Mark milestone {{version}} complete, archive to milestones/, and update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md.

Purpose: Create historical record of shipped version, archive milestone artifacts (roadmap + requirements), and prepare for next milestone.
Output: Milestone archived (roadmap + requirements), PROJECT.md evolved, git tagged.
</objective>

<execution_context>
**Load these files NOW (before proceeding):**

- @{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/workflows/complete-milestone.md (main workflow)
- @{{GSD_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/gsd-core/templates/milestone-archive.md (archive template)
  </execution_context>

<context>
**Project files:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/STATE.md`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**User input:**

- Version: {{version}} (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0")
  </context>

<process>

**Follow complete-milestone.md workflow:**

0. **Check for audit:**

   - Look for `.planning/v{{version}}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
   - If missing or stale: recommend `/gsd-audit-milestone` first
   - If audit status is `gaps_found`: recommend closing the gaps inline
     (the audit output already enumerates them — insert closure phases
     via `/gsd-phase --insert <N>` plus the standard
     discuss/plan/execute chain) before proceeding.
   - If audit status is `passed`: proceed to step 1

   ```markdown
   ## Pre-flight Check

   {If no v{{version}}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md:}
   ⚠ No milestone audit found. Run `/gsd-audit-milestone` first to verify
   requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and E2E flows.

   {If audit has gaps:}
   ⚠ Milestone audit found gaps. The audit output already enumerates the
   unsatisfied requirements, cross-phase issues, and broken flows — insert
   a closure phase per gap with `/gsd-phase --insert <N>` and run the
   standard `/gsd-discuss-phase` → `/gsd-plan-phase` → `/gsd-execute-phase`
   chain. Or proceed anyway to accept the gaps as tech debt.

   {If audit passed:}
   ✓ Milestone audit passed. Proceeding with completion.
   ```

1. **Verify readiness:**

   - Check all phases in milestone have completed plans (SUMMARY.md exists)
   - Present milestone scope and stats
   - Wait for confirmation

2. **Gather stats:**

   - Count phases, plans, tasks
   - Calculate git range, file changes, LOC
   - Extract timeline from git log
   - Present summary, confirm

3. **Extract accomplishments:**

   - Read all phase SUMMARY.md files in milestone range
   - Extract 4-6 key accomplishments
   - Present for approval

4. **Archive milestone:**

   - Create `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-ROADMAP.md`
   - Extract full phase details from ROADMAP.md
   - Fill milestone-archive.md template
   - Update ROADMAP.md to one-line summary with link

5. **Archive requirements:**

   - Create `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-REQUIREMENTS.md`
   - Mark all v1 requirements as complete (checkboxes checked)
   - Note requirement outcomes (validated, adjusted, dropped)
   - Delete `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (fresh one created for next milestone)

6. **Update PROJECT.md:**

   - Add "Current State" section with shipped version
   - Add "Next Milestone Goals" section
   - Archive previous content in `<details>` (if v1.1+)

7. **Commit and tag:**

   - Stage: MILESTONES.md, PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, archive files
   - Commit: `chore: archive v{{version}} milestone`
   - Tag: `git tag -a v{{version}} -m "[milestone summary]"`
   - Ask about pushing tag

8. **Offer next steps:**
   - `/gsd-new-milestone` — start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)

</process>

<success_criteria>

- Milestone archived to `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-ROADMAP.md`
- Requirements archived to `.planning/milestones/v{{version}}-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` deleted (fresh for next milestone)
- ROADMAP.md collapsed to one-line entry
- PROJECT.md updated with current state
- Git tag v{{version}} created (if `git.create_tag` enabled)
- Commit successful
- User knows next steps (including need for fresh requirements)
  </success_criteria>

<critical_rules>

- **Load workflow first:** Read complete-milestone.md before executing
- **Verify completion:** All phases must have SUMMARY.md files
- **User confirmation:** Wait for approval at verification gates
- **Archive before deleting:** Always create archive files before updating/deleting originals
- **One-line summary:** Collapsed milestone in ROADMAP.md should be single line with link
- **Context efficiency:** Archive keeps ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md constant size per milestone
- **Fresh requirements:** Next milestone starts with `/gsd-new-milestone` which includes requirements definition
  </critical_rules>
